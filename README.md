# Welcome to SpellIt!

SpellIt was designed to help with the creation of affix and dictionary files for use with Hunspell. The web interface allows the user to input verb forms and paradigms, and export the generated affix and dictionary files. 

If you are simply looking to use SpellIt, keep reading. If instead you're looking to contribute to the development of SpellIt, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Hun-Spell-It/SpellIt/wiki).

## Using SpellIt
To access SpellIt, simply visit [http://www.spellit.duckdns.org:4200/](http://www.spellit.duckdns.org:4200/)

The interface was designed to be as friendly as possible, but a user manual is also in the works. Stay tuned for detail on that.
